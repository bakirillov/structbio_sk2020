## Reproduction

The code is based on the repository of the original paper. I just have modified the original a little bit (otp_example_Modified.ipynb) and made a CycleGAN version (CycleGAN_example). The preprocessing, loading and so on is made by the authors of the original paper.

1. `git clone https://github.com/learningmatter-mit/Coarse-Graining-Auto-encoders`     
2. copy files CycleGAN_example.ipynb and otp_example_Modified.ipynb into the previously created folder      
3. run the files
